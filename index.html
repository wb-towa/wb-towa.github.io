            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                A UK based software engineer with years of experience writing 
                software for the web, desktop / mobile and automation.
            </p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                So far, most of my career has focused on web development with a
                preference towards the backend. This has included things such as an 
                e-commerce web service and asset management systems for publishers,
                cloud-based digital signage management systems and SaaS security micro-services.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in addition to web development I‚Äôve written software for geophysics
                companies. This includes things such as plug-ins for related software 
                (<a href="https://www.dgbes.com">OpendTect</a>), tooling for processing
                binary survey data and data logging and control software for gravity
                gradiometer hardware. This role was quite cool actually and allowed me to
                try my hand at signal processing on 3D cards using Cuda (but no
                <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL'>OpenCL</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Last, but not least, I‚Äôve also enjoyed writing test automation software
                for common tasks like testing websites. Testing VM-based security
                software and automation for testing physical hardware which included
                both building hardware rigs and writing the automation framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of my career has been office based but I do have over two years of
                remote experience and find it just as enjoyable as more traditional means.
