            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>web</h3>
            <p>The bulk of my career has been spent on a wealth of web development. Much of my focus has been on back-end services covering a range of tasks from e-Commerce, Asset management and high throughput data processing.
            </p>
            <p>I've also spent years doing front-end development too with Javascript and CSS. Everything from using good plain old Javascript to frameworks such as React.
            </p>
            <h3>automation</h3>
            <p>A few years of experience writing test automation software and relevant result, statistics tracking software.</p>
            <p>Automation frameworks for web browser software and software for PC hardware devices. Some of the development has been more in-depth than what most people do. As an example, rather than just using Selenium, extending Selenium's funcitonality for the given task.
            </p>
            <h3>data processing</h3>
            <p>Worked for a geophysical survey company writing software to help with a range of tasks including writing / parsing binary data formats, GPU based data processing, 3D software plugins, software for controlling the data logging of gravity gradiometer and project management software (both desktop in C#, server side in Python).</p>
